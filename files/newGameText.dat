After an extended voyage spent traveling through interstellar space aboard the Lexington you awaken from a cryogenically frozen state. You and your fellow crew members are now in orbit around the planet Kepler-283c. Your mission is simple yet extremely dangerous. You’ve come to this planet to collect its many inordinately valuable resources. But unfortunately, your ship sustained heavy damage during your voyage and will need to be repaired if you are to return home.
You and your fellow teammates will board the Lexington's planet landing module and go to the planet surface. While your teammates' task is to gather resources you’ve been charged with stealing the necessary ship parts from the native inhabitants. The inhabits of Kepler-283 are extremely dangerous and will eliminate you if you fail to eliminate them. The toxic atmosphere will kill you if you fail to keep an adequate supply. And, failing to collect the necessary parts for your damaged ship will result in the death of yourself and all your crew members.
