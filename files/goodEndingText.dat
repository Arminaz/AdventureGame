You have successful gathered the necessary parts and you have returned to the Lexington. The Lexington is now fully functional and the hull of your ship is full. The Lexington groans in ascent as you punch through the atmosphere of the planet. Your crewmates celebrate having gathered enough resources from the planet, and with a final glance back, you see the last trace of the planet become nothing more than a speck in the corner of your vision. You sigh to yourself, and wonder if this is the start of something new, of something...better.
