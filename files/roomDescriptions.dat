A table stands in the middle of your path, blood splattered across its length. Surgical tools hang along the wall, each more menacing than the last. You hope to be rid of this room as quick as you are able.
Cages line the wall of the room you now found yourself in. Almost like a zoo, you wonder what manner of beasts would be contained in these cages. Having fought the aliens, you cannot imagine something they would find frightening.
Chains of shackles bolted to the wall mark what you think to be a detainment room of some kind. Blood lines the walls, bodily fluids were spilt upon the ground, and a rotten carcass of some creature lie not five paces from your current position. You scrunch your nose; perhaps this was the creature emitting the stench.
Small stone slabs rest against the walls of this room. Almost like a living quarter, it reminds you of the comfort you once found on the Lexington. Well, what little comfort you could find, anyhow.
There was little light within the room, and you find yourself squinting to make out even the tiniest bit of detail. The darkness ebbs and flows around you, sending shivers down your spine; you hope you don’t have to walk far within this room.
A collection of vials greets your eyes as you enter the storage room. They were all filled with a sample of some kind, perhaps from an animal. All the containers were labeled, but in markings that looked crude and...beastly. You wonder what sorts of animals and beasts these samples came from.
The eastern part of the courtyard housed what appeared to be a large garden of assorted plants. You are no botanist, and so the plants mean little to nothing to you. Beyond, however, is a metal door. Behind it, only your imagination can guess.
You found yourself beneath the massive mushroom-like fungus that emitted a blue light. It was hypnotic in a way, and you found yourself losing time staring at the mushroom’s wonder. Soon, however, you break free of the trance and continue on your way.
The smell of smoke lingers in the hallway. You wonder what could be its source, and what might hide within.
The small hamlet, tucked in near the back of the cave, had a hole in the roof, allowing a faint sliver of light to penetrate the darkness. A small hub of bushes and fungus grows in the light. You find yourself calm, for once. Perhaps this isn’t as bad as you thought.
The outline of something large has made its nest at the back of the cave, you realize as you approach the cave’s edge. The indent made into the dirt suggested repeated hibernation. Beside the hole, you see skulls, with some of them looking human in shape. You shiver as the fingers of anxiety wormed their way up from your belly. This is a creature you did not wish to meet.
A massive hole breaches the outer wall of the compound, as though a morter punched its way through. Moss and lichen have grown around the rubble, suffocating the stone beneath. This hole has been here a while, you determine.
The entryway to what appears to be a courtyard stands before you. Beyond, you see flowers and shrubs you have never before laid eyes on, with one in particular emitting a blue glow. Beside you, a reinforced door blocks your path, with a rustic terminal-looking machine beside it. You wonder what is beyond the door that would require such security.
More scratchings and markings adorn the walls as you walk through the hallway. You try not to notice them as you continue walking, pushing from your mind the thought of what could live here.
There is a smell as you walk into the entryway of the massive compound that assaults your nose through your suit. It is a smell you do not know well, but if you were to harbor a guess, you would say it was the smell of decomposition.
The long corridor wove this way and that, but you managed to find your way through with ease. There is little you discern in the gloom, and so you pay little attention to your surroundings.
Before you stands a large hole in the compound which leads down into a cave-like shaft. You feel a wave of nervous energy flicker through you. What could possibly be down here?
You continue making your way through the tunnel. There are small, narrow paths you cannot worm your way through, and so you stick to the large, open main path. Footprints are scattered through the dirt below you, and you wonder if they were created by your companions or by someone--or something--else.
You notice the cave ahead splitting into two, and you wonder which path you will take. The path to the north looked more inviting, but you think you can make out a familiar shape down the opposite path. You take a moment to think about your options. 
The ruins of an old structure stand ahead of you. Rubble and strewn bits of stone litter the ground, and you haphazardly walk between them to avoid tripping and making a fool of yourself. A rusty, dirt-covered terminal marks the faint outline of a door. You hope by hacking the terminal you can reveal what is behind the door.
The storage room is packed with tools and materials, all of which look, at first glance, completely useless. You chide yourself for thinking anything useful would be behind the door.
Two massive, metal doors mark the entrance to a walled-off structure now in the middle of your path. The stone making up the walls was remarkable, quite unlike anything you had seen before. A marble grey, looking smooth to the touch. You notice long, thin claw marks torn into the side of the wall, dug nearly as deep as the width of your arm. You try not to think of what creature might have done that, for it would, you decide, be a rather unfortunate meeting.
You find yourself in an old storage suite, though what it used to store is beyond you. 
The large, towering tree-like structures cast heavy shadows about the small, in-dug valley you now find yourself in.  Darkness surrounds you, and an eerie feeling washes over you. You are not sure your fellow companions came this way, but you continue on nonetheless.
You stand before the hull of the Lexington, watching the rays of light reflect off the metal surface, creating gleaming splotches of light around the landing zone. You will find those ship parts and get the ship working again, this you vow, if only for your own sanity.
