Donald Pearce: Mark, buddy, pal, everyone’s favorite convict. it’s awesome to see you planet side. Can you believe it? How lucky are we to be right here right now in this corner of the universe?

Mark Ember: Given that we’re all forced to be here. Given we might run out of oxygen and die of aphsyixation. Give that there is a hostile alien race looking to end us. Given no choice but to carry out the wishes of our masters, I would have to say we’re pretty unlucky.

Donald Peace: Well you know ol’ Donny, always looking at the bright side of life. Never a moment that I am not greatful for.

Mark Ember: I’m greatful for every moment I don’t have to talk to you.

Donald Peace: Haha, always joking around Mark. 

Mark Ember: I wasn’t.

Donald Pearce: That’s not very nice.

Mark Ember: Just tell me how to get into the next room.

Donald Pearce: Okay. The room next to us is one of the most secure I’ve ever seen but fortunately I have detected it’s weakness.

Mark Ember: Oh ya, what’s that?

Mark Ember: … correctly spelled words Donald …correctly spelled words.
